title: Projects
---

For me, anything that has a starting point and that I believe can lead to a goal through effort over a certain period of time can fall within the scope of a project. Usually, the starting point can be ideas where I think 'it would be nice if something like this existed' or ideas where I'll learn something during the process of making them. There's also a possibility that I might undertake tasks that won't be useful to anyone. The projects I do here have no connection to my full-time job, and there's no concern for generating income (though the concern about expenses is quite high).
