title: Dryer Machine - Thermal cut off switch

Our dryer machine stopped heating after using it for 8 months, but everything else seemed functional. All the programs started fine, and the tumbler was turning as expected. The only issue was that, there was no heat anywhere, causing the clothes not to dry as they should. 

We contacted the call center of the brand, and they scheduled a service technician. The technician quickly fixed the problem and kindly explained the issue.

It turned out that on the back of the device, there is an electronic switch that functions like a fuse â€“ also known as a thermal cut off switch, which prevents the machine from overheating and causing further damage. In our case, for some reason, that switch had been disabled. The solution was simply to enable it again. 

The technician also demonstrated how to enable the switch in case it happens again. It only requires removing a few screws to access the switch, and that's it. 

I believe we forgot to clean the inner filter after each run, which probably was the root cause of the problem.
