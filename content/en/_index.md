I'm Ahmet. I work as a software development engineer at Amazon in Cambridge, UK. I am helping to make Alexa smarter in Alexa NU (Natural Understanding) department.

Previously, I was working at Huawei where I helped delivering features to big telco companies in different countries. I also helped designing and prototyping many ideas, which some of them became a product later.

Outside of work, I enjoy making things or use "things" in ways that they are not intended (hacking?). I also have been taking photographs which are mostly taken by an analog camera for the last couple of years.

In this very solitary corner of the internet, I try to create content in different formats which mostly optimized for me to produce content easier and fun. I hope you'll find them useful as well.
