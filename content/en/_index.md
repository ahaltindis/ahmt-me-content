I am Ahmet. I work as a software development engineer at Amazon in Cambridge, UK. I am helping to make Alexa smarter in the Alexa NU (Natural Understanding) department.

Outside of work, I enjoy making things or using "things" in ways that they are not intended (hacking?). I also have been taking [photographs]({{< relref "photographs" >}}), mostly with an analog camera, for quite some time.

In this very solitary corner of the internet, I try to create content in various formats that are mostly optimized for me to produce them more easily and enjoyably. I hope you'll find something useful or interesting.
